## Podcast Notes

### STARTUPS FOR THE REST OF US
I started listening to the podcast Indie Hackers in November 2021. That got me started on a journey of learning more about startups in general. From that podcast I learned about different technologies and businesses that help people start their own businesses. And I learned about different start ups.

One of the other startup podcasts that I learned about is Startups For The Rest Of Us. 

Today I'm listening to episode #583. Rob Walling, the host, chats with Sam Parr about startup ideas, podcast growth, and spotting business opportunities.

Very good episode. A lot of great insights. 

But even more than this is resources. There are a couple of reasons that we read books and listen to podcast. It's the resources. I can listen to a podcast from someone I want to be more like and get resources on how the got where they are. But it's also how I train my mind to think in different ways. 

I don't just read a book to get a list of ideas. I read a book because that act of reading teaching my mind to think like the writer thinks. 

Reading is like being on a treadmill for the mind. It teaches the mind to emulate the ways of thinking of the writer.

### Mixergy

Mixergy: I had never heard of them. So I headed over and checked out their website. (Mixergy)[https://mixergy.com/] Seems freaking awesome content. 

One of the first things I stumbled across on their site was (Directly Apply Interview)[https://mixergy.com/interviews/directlyapply-with-dylan-buckley/]. It touches on the concept that I think about a lot with trying to make my own start up.

Where do I start? What about starting things that other people have done?

So this company runs a job board. And the interview addresses the topic, why in the world would we need another job board?

There is this idea that if you start a company you should do something that no one else has done. And that is one way to a path to success. But even with a company like this. Another job board. There can be room in a really crowded marketplace for one more at the table.

And a lot of this depends on what a person or company's goals are.

In a crowded space like this, there is room for a company that creates the solution a little bit differently. So he's taking the problem that has been well established. Job search and recruiting is a well established company. 

But the way that recruiting works hasn't much changed over the past 25 years. There is this burden of job search uses a lot of the old technology.

The DirectApply learns about the behavior of the user on what looks like a traditional site, but underneath the website learns about the users behavior and starts doing a better job of sending the right kind of jobs to the applicant. It helps the person applying find better jobs over time through learning their behavior.

It's based on financial recruitment and data analyst teams. So the best way to do matchmaking with jobs is to really drill down into niches. Like developers or data scientists.

The best way is to automate the technical search. It's a balance between doing a lot of vetting that recruiters do and no vetting with websites like Indeed.

High demand for talent and shortage of job applicants. Finance professionals are the first example that they came up with.

This ties back to the episode where Start Ups For The Rest Of Us was talking about finding niches. In that example, he's talking about the trucking industry is having a shortage on finding workers. Sam Parr explains that he's interested in the trucking industry and that lead generation is a great place to start a business. 

Literally helping trucking companies find new employees can be a great business.

You can do traditional advertising. In the UK, most of the jobs on the job sites are for staffing agencies. So they built a chrome plugin that would remove the staffing agencies and that just left the direct hiring platforms.

Staffing agencies are only bad because they often making it harder to get hired.
