<h2>Podcast Notes</h2>
<h3>STARTUPS FOR THE REST OF US</h3>
<p>I started listening to the podcast Indie Hackers in November 2021. That got me started on a journey of learning more about startups in general. From that podcast I learned about different technologies and businesses that help people start their own businesses. And I learned about different start ups.</p>
<p>One of the other startup podcasts that I learned about is Startups For The Rest Of Us.</p>
<p>Today I'm listening to episode #583. Rob Walling, the host, chats with Sam Parr about startup ideas, podcast growth, and spotting business opportunities.</p>
<p>Very good episode. A lot of great insights.</p>
<p>But even more than this is resources. There are a couple of reasons that we read books and listen to podcast. It's the resources. I can listen to a podcast from someone I want to be more like and get resources on how the got where they are. But it's also how I train my mind to think in different ways.</p>
<p>I don't just read a book to get a list of ideas. I read a book because that act of reading teaching my mind to think like the writer thinks.</p>
<p>Reading is like being on a treadmill for the mind. It teaches the mind to emulate the ways of thinking of the writer.</p>
<h3>Mixergy</h3>
<p>Mixergy: I had never heard of them. So I headed over and checked out their website. (Mixergy)[https://mixergy.com/] Seems freaking awesome content.</p>
<p>One of the first things I stumbled across on their site was (Directly Apply Interview)[https://mixergy.com/interviews/directlyapply-with-dylan-buckley/]. It touches on the concept that I think about a lot with trying to make my own start up.</p>
<p>Where do I start? What about starting things that other people have done?</p>
<p>So this company runs a job board. And the interview addresses the topic, why in the world would we need another job board?</p>
<p>There is this idea that if you start a company you should do something that no one else has done. And that is one way to a path to success. But even with a company like this. Another job board. There can be room in a really crowded marketplace for one more at the table.</p>
<p>And a lot of this depends on what a person or company's goals are.</p>
<p>In a crowded space like this, there is room for a company that creates the solution a little bit differently. So he's taking the problem that has been well established. Job search and recruiting is a well established company.</p>
<p>But the way that recruiting works hasn't much changed over the past 25 years. There is this burden of job search uses a lot of the old technology.</p>
<p>The DirectApply learns about the behavior of the user on what looks like a traditional site, but underneath the website learns about the users behavior and starts doing a better job of sending the right kind of jobs to the applicant. It helps the person applying find better jobs over time through learning their behavior.</p>
<p>It's based on financial recruitment and data analyst teams. So the best way to do matchmaking with jobs is to really drill down into niches. Like developers or data scientists.</p>
<p>The best way is to automate the technical search. It's a balance between doing a lot of vetting that recruiters do and no vetting with websites like Indeed.</p>
<p>High demand for talent and shortage of job applicants. Finance professionals are the first example that they came up with.</p>
<p>This ties back to the episode where Start Ups For The Rest Of Us was talking about finding niches. In that example, he's talking about the trucking industry is having a shortage on finding workers. Sam Parr explains that he's interested in the trucking industry and that lead generation is a great place to start a business.</p>
<p>Literally helping trucking companies find new employees can be a great business.</p>
<p>You can do traditional advertising. In the UK, most of the jobs on the job sites are for staffing agencies. So they built a chrome plugin that would remove the staffing agencies and that just left the direct hiring platforms.</p>
<p>Staffing agencies are only bad because they often making it harder to get hired.</p>
