<h1>Tech Turtle Website</h1>
<p>This is the readme for the project/website for Tech Turtle.</p>
<p>Tech Turtle is a blog/website where I keep notes on technology, business concepts, and environment concepts.</p>
<p>Tech Turtle is where those ideas collide and intercept and my ongoing research and thoughts about them.</p>
<h2>Tech Turtle Technologies</h2>
<p>The site is made with <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/docs/getting-started/">Eleventy</a> and Netlify. It's basically some markdown files that are some notes about what I'm learning.</p>
<h2>Eleventy</h2>
