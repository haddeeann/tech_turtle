# Tech Turtle Website
This is the readme for the project/website for Tech Turtle.

Tech Turtle is a blog/website where I keep notes on technology, business concepts, and environment concepts.

Tech Turtle is where those ideas collide and intercept and my ongoing research and thoughts about them.

## Tech Turtle Technologies
The site is made with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/getting-started/) and Netlify. It's basically some markdown files that are some notes about what I'm learning.
